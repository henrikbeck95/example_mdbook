The "Hello, World!" program is a simple yet iconic piece of source code used to demonstrate the basic syntax of a programming language. The myth surrounding its origin traces back to the early days of computer programming. According to popular belief, the first "Hello, World!" program was written by Brian Kernighan, a computer scientist at Bell Labs, in the early 1970s.

Kernighan, along with Dennis Ritchie, created the C programming language, which quickly gained popularity. As the story goes, Kernighan was working on a tutorial to teach C programming to beginners. He needed a minimalistic program that could be easily understood and executed by novice programmers. In search of a suitable example, he came across an earlier program written by Martin Richards, another computer scientist who had used the phrase "Hello, World!" to test the capabilities of his BCPL programming language. Kernighan decided to adopt the phrase and included it in his tutorial, solidifying its place in programming folklore.

While there is some debate over the exact origins of the "Hello, World!" program, Kernighan's tutorial and its inclusion of the phrase certainly played a significant role in popularizing it. Today, the "Hello, World!" program has become a tradition in the programming community, with developers often using it as their first line of code when learning a new language. It serves as a simple yet powerful introduction to the world of programming and continues to inspire beginners as they embark on their coding journeys.
